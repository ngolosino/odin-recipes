    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced pepperoni sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped black olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and oil. Stir in the yeast mixture. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Transfer to a lightly greased pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spoon pizza sauce over crust and evenly distribute with a spoon. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and top with pepperoni slices, mushrooms, green pepper, onion, and olives.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese and crust are golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
